\item Here is a list item ending with an equation using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2
\end{equation}

\item Observe the amount of space between the equation above and this item, which is larger than it should be.

\item For comparison, the equation that ends the list item uses the original \LaTeX\ display math commands (preserved by \texttt{AC@displaymath}):
\makeatletter
\AC@displaymath
E=mc^2
\AC@enddisplaymath
\makeatother

\item The space between the second equation and this item is at it should be.
