# ACCESSIBILITY
Create a tagged and structured PDF file.

By Babett Schalitz & Andy Clifton

Last updated 13 October 2019
Version 2.0.2

## Description

The `accessibility` package  is intended to create tagged, structured PDF documents from LaTeX2e source code.

This package is intended for documents produced using PDFLaTeX.

Originally programmed in 2007 by Babett Schalitz as a Masters project at
TU Dresden, the maintenance of the accessibility package has been taken up
by Andrew Clifton with her agreement.

### Note to version 2.0.x releases

These versions are based almost entirely on Babett's hard work. I have made
some changes to the source code to make the output files conform to CTAN
requirements and to make it simpler to work with GitHub.

### Bugs, errors, feedback

Please report all problems to https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility/issues. Also, please note that I cannot enter into detailed discussions about individual documents, but am happy to address anything that might impact all users.
