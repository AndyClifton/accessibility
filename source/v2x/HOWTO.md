# Notes to v2x Source
These versions are based almost entirely on Babett's hard work. I have made
some changes to the source code to make the output files conform to CTAN
requirements and to make it simpler to work with GitHub. See [CHANGELOG.md](v2x/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## File manifest

### Markdown
- README.md: This file will be included in the submission to CTAN.
- CHANGELOG.md: a changelog.

## LaTeX
- accessibility.dtx: The accessibility package, which will be included in the submission to CTAN
- compatability.tex:
- anleitung-DE.tex: instructions (in German)

### Scripts

## How to modify the `accessibility.sty` file
### The quick and dirty way
You could just modify `accessibility.sty` directly. This is fine for testing new ideas, but has the disadvantage that it is not how you are _supposed_ to do it (see following).

### The proper way
`accessibility.sty` is actually created from the `accessibility.ins` (configuration) and `accessibility.dtx` (content) files.

So, to make a change to `accessibility.sty`, you need to first modify the `accessibility.dtx` file.

You can then update `accessibility.sty` by running `accessibility.ins` through latex:

```bash
latex accessibility.ins
```

This is implemented in the [`make_accessibility.sh`](make_accessibility.sh) script.

## Testing `accessibility.sty`

### Automated testing
The basic test for `accessibility.sty` is to see if documents that use it compile.

The [`run_tests.sh`](run_tests.sh) script compiles example documents that use the `accessibility` package. These are included in the [`../tests`](../tests) directory in this repository.

These tests are also run automatically when a new commit is made on Github.

### Manual testing
You should also _manually_ check the structure of the PDF files generated using `accessibility` and confirm that they are OK.

You can test the PDF files using e.g.:
- PDF Accessibility Checker (Windows only): https://www.access-for-all.ch/ch/pdf-werkstatt/pdf-accessibility-checker-pac.html
- The Tingtun Checker (web-based, makes tests without modifying): http://checkers.eiii.eu/en/pdfcheck/
- PAVE (web-based, makes makes changes automatically): http://pave-pdf.org/index.en.html
- Acrobat Pro: https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html
- Common Look's PDF validator (a plugin for Adobe Acrobat that tests against multiple standadrds): https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator/


## Preparing for submission to CTAN
### 1. Update all version information
Version information is included in [`accessibility.dtx`](v2x/accessibility.dtx). This information should be updated for every new submission to CTAN.

There are 3 locations where version information is included: search for the text, `VERSION INFO` and modify the version information in the lines following that marker.

### 2. Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md files
See [`README.md`](README.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](v2x/CHANGELOG.md).

### 3. Gather files
The [`prepare_for_CTAN.sh`](prepare_for_CTAN.sh) script prepares the `accessibility` package for CTAN using the `ctanify` perl script. `ctanify` is included in all latex distributions.

For more information about `ctanify`, see [the package notes on CTAN](http://ftp.fau.de/ctan/support/ctanify/ctanify.pdf).

The `prepare_for_CTAN.sh` script creates a file, `v2x/accessibilty.tar.gz` that contains all of the files required for CTAN.

For more information about how to prepare files for upload to CTAN, see
- https://ctan.org/help/upload-pkg
- https://ctan.org/file/help/ctan/CTAN-upload-addendum.

### 4. Upload to CTAN
`accessibilty.tar.gz` should be submitted to CTAN through https://ctan.org/upload.

Note:
- The package location at CTAN is `macros/latex/contrib/accessibility/``
