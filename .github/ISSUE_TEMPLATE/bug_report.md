**Accessibility is no longer maintained**
The question of accessibility in PDFs has now been taken up by the LaTeX project in a multiyear project and as a result **I am stopping work on this package and it should be considered "unmaintained"**. Issues are only being collected to provide test cases for later use.

See https://www.latex-project.org/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/ for news about this initiative.

The article, ["LaTeX Tagged PDF â€” A blueprint for a large project"](https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2020-FMi-TUB-tb129mitt-tagpdf.pdf) may be particularly useful as an overview.

Note that my work on `accessibility.sty` is not associated with the LaTeX project.
