# The `Accessibility` LaTeX package

Authors: Babett Schalitz, Andrew Clifton

This repository contains the `accessibility` LaTeX package.

`Accessibility` improves the structure and tagging of PDF files generated from LaTeX. These features make PDF documents machine readable and thus enable document readers (e.g. the Adobe Acrobat series) to automatically process and present the document.

The package was originally created as part of a diploma thesis by Babett Schalitz in 2007. The thesis was called 'Accessibility-Erhöhung von LATEX-Dokumenten'. More information can be found at http://babs.gmxhome.de/da_start.htm.
