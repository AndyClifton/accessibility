# The `Accessibility` LaTeX package

Authors: Babett Schalitz, Andrew (Andy) Clifton

This repository contains the files required to build and test the `accessibility` LaTeX package.

`Accessibility` improves the structure and tagging of PDF files generated from LaTeX. These features make PDF documents machine readable and thus enable document readers (e.g. the Adobe Acrobat series) to automatically process and present the document.

You can obtain the `accessibility` package [through CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/accessibility).

## History

The package was originally created as part of a diploma thesis by Babett Schalitz in 2007. The thesis was called 'Accessibility-Erhöhung von LATEX-Dokumenten'. More information can be found at [her home page](http://babs.gmxhome.de/da_start.htm).

Andy Clifton took on maintenance of the package in May 2019 with permission and support from Babett Schalitz. Babett provided copies of the original files from 2007, not all of which were available online before. Those files can be found in the [/source/v1](/sourcce/v1) directory and as [release v0.2](https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility/releases/tag/v0.2-beta).

## What's in this repository
This repository contains all of the files required to build and test the accessibility.sty file. **It is not intended to be used directly in LaTeX.**

## Installing `accessibility` on your latex system
If all you want is to use `accessibility` on one of your documents, then this is not the repository you are looking for.

You are strongly recommended to obtain the `accessibility` package [through CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/accessibility). That distribution has all of the files that you might require to install accessibility on your system. I suggest installation using an appropriate package manager.

If you really want to download the `accessibility` package from here, please download the current release from [releases/](https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility/releases). You can then install it on your own system. I cannot provide any help for this. Please see [the 'Tex stackexchange for more information on the installation process](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te).

## Cooperation and Collaboration
Now that the licensing for this package is clearly defined, I hope people will consider collaborating on maintaining and improving the package. If you are interested, please just get on and do whatever, or raise an issue to discuss.

## Support, bugs, errors, and feedback
This style file might or might not work. The PDF output might be junk. Or you might have a document that needs something more.

Please report all problems to [the accessibility package issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility/issues). Also, please note that I cannot enter into detailed discussions about individual documents, but am happy to address anything that might impact all users.
